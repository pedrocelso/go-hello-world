# go-hello-world
An Hello World! written in GO.

### What is this about?
This is an example project, It's an Hello Worldish code, but with some helper methods to show how to write unit tests in GO using `testing` package.

### Usage
#### Running the hello.go file
Assuming that you previously downloaded GO binary from https://golang.org/dl/, all you have to do is run `go run hello.go` from your command line.

#### Running tests
All you have to do is run `go test messages/messages_test.go` from your command line.

### Google App Engine
There's one branch (`moving-to-gae`) that I used to run an basic Hello World on Google App Engine.
